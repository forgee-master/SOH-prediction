## Preprocessing.py -->

1. The preprocessing net is little questionable, as it does not allow to work  with raw datasets too. 
Raw dataset generator exists.

2. The preprocessing convolutions for charge and partial charge does not undergo batch/layer normalization.

3. What are these 4 features, we have to only depend on?

4. 67 handcrafted features are getting converted to 128*4. This is high dimensional space. How effective is it?

    - Batch Normalization has been added. Need to perform testing with and without to see its effects are good or bad.

3. What are these 4 features, we have to only depend on?
    - Voltage, Current, Temperature, relative_time_min

4. 67 handcrafted features are getting converted to 128*4. This is high dimensional space. How effective is it?
    - 


## LSTM/GRU -->

1. Why is it so bad?


## Attention -->

1. Why does it have a bias?



## SOH Plot -->

1. Why is SOH Plot an increasing decresaing curve?
     - It is a natural Phenomenon referred as capcity recovery or initial capacity rise.
